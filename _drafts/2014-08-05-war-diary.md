Operation War Diary is a project launched by Zoouniverse in partnership with the Imperial War Museum and the National Archives to transcribe and tag diaries of the British Army that were written on the Western Front.

The goal of this "operation" is to make untold stories and facts from the First World War available to academics, researchers, and family historians around the world.

CartoDB has played a key role in rendering and sharing this historical content by supporting innovative visualizations. With our platform, Operation War Diary has chronicled 200 battalion diaries of soldiers killed in action between 1914 and 1918.
